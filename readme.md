## Summary of Findings

> I found that the main User Category is Subscribers and they mainly use bikes to go to work on the other hand customers use them for entertainment and they rent them on weekends not like subscribers. also customers have higher trip duration 

> most frequent users aged between 20 and 45. As remark, duration is registered by younger members.
